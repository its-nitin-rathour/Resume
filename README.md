## üíª Academic Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Detection using Hybrid Ensemble Modeling  
*Scikit-learn, Keras, Random Forest, Autoencoder, Isolation Forest*  
[üîó Project Link](https://github.com/its-nitin-rathour/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Hybrid-Ensemble-Modeling)

- Built a hybrid model (Random Forest + Autoencoder + Isolation Forest) for imbalanced credit card fraud detection (284K+ records, 0.17% fraud).
- Applied dynamic threshold tuning to hybrid scores, boosting fraud-class F1-score to 0.88 and AUC to 0.97.
- Achieved precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.81, reducing false positives by 50% versus baselines.



### Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI  
*Power BI, SQL Server, DAX*  
[üîó Dashboard Link](https://github.com/its-nitin-rathour/Bank-Loan-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-Bi)

- Built interactive dashboards to track loan KPIs such as funded amount, received payments, interest rate, and DTI.
- Used DAX to implement MTD and MoM calculations with slicers and custom visuals for deeper insights.
- Designed summary, overview, and detail pages with charts to analyze trends by region, loan type, and borrower profile.
